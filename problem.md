Problem statement:
---
**Scenario:**

You are a medieval king attacking your opponent at five locations simultaneously.
Each location has a platoon - which has a number of soldiers of a specific class.
You know the platoons your opponent has.
Your job is to figure out which of your platoons should attack which of your opponent's platoons so that you can win majority of the battles.

In general, one soldier of your platoon will be able to handle one soldier of your opponent's platoon.

If your platoon has 100 soldiers and your opponent's platoon has:
* 99 soldiers - You Win
* 100 soldiers - Draw
* 101 soldiers - You Lose

**Platoon Classes**

There are 6 classes of soldiers:
- Militia
- Spearmen
- Light Cavalry
- Heavy Cavalry
- Foot Archer
- Cavalry Archer

Each class of soldier has an advantage over other classes of soldiers

| Unit Class    | Advantage Over                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Militia       | Spearmen, LightCavalry            |
| Spearmen      | LightCavalry, HeavyCavalry        |
| LightCavalry  | FootArcher, CavalryArcher         |
| HeavyCavalry  | Militia, FootArcher, LightCavalry |
| CavalryArcher | Spearmen, HeavyCavalry            |
| FootArcher    | Militia, CavalryArcher            |

The soldiers who have advantage over the opponent, will be able to handle twice the amount of opponent's soldiers

If your platoon has 100 Spearmen and your opponent's platoon has:

* 199 HeavyCavalry - You Win
* 200 HeavyCavalry - Draw
* 201 HeavyCavalry - You Lose


The input to the problem statement is the list of platoons that you have with their classes and number of units in the first line

The second line contains the list of platoons of the opponent (PlatoonClasses#NoOfSoldiers)

Spearmen#10;Militia#30;FootArcher#20;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120

Militia#10;Spearmen#10;FootArcher#1000;LightCavalry#120;CavalryArcher#100

The output of the program should be to give a sequence in which you should arrange your platoons so that you win atleast 3 of the 5 battles.

There could be multiple winning arrangements, it is enough to print one of the possible arrangements

If there is no possibility to get atleast 3 out of 5 wins in any arrangement, it should intimate that with an error message that "There is no chance of winning"

**Sample Input:**

Spearmen#10;Militia#30;FootArcher#20;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120

Militia#10;Spearmen#10;FootArcher#1000;LightCavalry#120;CavalryArcher#100

**Sample Output:**

Militia#30;FootArcher#20;Spearmen#10;LightCavalry#1000;HeavyCavalry#120

**Explanation:**

|          | Own Platoon       | Opponent Platoon  | Outcome |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Battle 1 | Militia#30        | Militia#10        | Win     |
| Battle 2 | FootArcher#20     | Spearmen#10       | Win     |
| Battle 3 | Spearmen#10       | FootArcher#1000   | Loss    |
| Battle 4 | LightCavalry#1000 | LightCavalry#120  | Win     |
| Battle 5 | HeavyCavalry#120  | CavalryArcher#100 | Loss    |

Thus 3/5 battles can be won in this order.
